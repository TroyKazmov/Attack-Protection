# Attack-Protection
Enhanced cyber-attack protection implementation with monitoring (Made by me)

HOW TO INSTALL:

This is a Node.js script that will generate all the files for the enhanced botnet protection system. You can run this script to automatically create the complete project structure with all necessary files.

This script will create a complete project structure with all the necessary files for the enhanced botnet protection system. The script:

1. Creates the main project directory
2. Sets up all subdirectories (src, logs, data, etc.)
3. Creates all source files with their content
4. Provides instructions on how to use the project


After running this script, you'll have a fully functional botnet protection system with:

- Advanced rate limiting
- Bot detection
- IP blocklist management
- Security dashboard
- Comprehensive logging
- API endpoints for management


To use the script:

1. Copy the code above into a file named `generate-complete-project.js`
2. Run it with Node.js: 'node generate-complete-project.js'

```shellscript
node generate-complete-project.js
```

The script will create a directory called `enhanced-botnet-protection` with all the files organized in the correct structure. You can then follow the printed instructions to build and run the project.

‼️𝐈𝐌𝐏𝐎𝐑𝐓𝐀𝐍𝐓, 𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐃!👈⚒️🚩

This enhanced script includes:

1. **Detailed Comments**: Throughout the code files explaining what each component does and how to customize it
2. **Clear Instructions**: For accessing the dashboard with authentication parameters
3. **Security Notes**: Highlighting areas that should be improved for production use
4. **Customization Points**: Marked sections where you might want to modify the code
5. **Better Dashboard UI**: Added explanatory text in the dashboard UI
6. **Improved README**: With clearer instructions on accessing the dashboard


## How to Access the Security Dashboard

After running the project:

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard?username=admin&password=changeme`

1. Replace `admin` and `changeme` with the values you set in your `.env` file
2. The authentication parameters are passed in the URL query string



2. From the dashboard, you can:

1. View real-time statistics on rate limiting and blocked IPs
2. Manually block or unblock IP addresses
3. Access security logs by clicking "View Security Logs"



3. The security logs page shows detailed information about security events:

1. When they occurred
2. What type of event (blocked request, bot detection, etc.)
3. The IP address involved
4. Additional details like user agent or reason for blocking



## Important Security Notes

1. The authentication method used (query parameters) is basic and for demonstration purposes only
2. For production use, implement a more secure authentication method like sessions or JWT
3. Always change the default admin username and password in the `.env` file
4. Consider placing the system behind a reverse proxy like Nginx for additional security

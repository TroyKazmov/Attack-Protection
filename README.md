## Overview

This project provides a robust security layer for web applications to protect against botnet attacks. It includes rate limiting, bot detection, IP blocklisting, and a real-time monitoring dashboard.

## Features

- **Advanced Rate Limiting**: Automatically detect and block IPs that exceed request thresholds
- **Bot Detection**: Identify malicious bots using behavioral analysis and pattern recognition
- **IP Blocklist Integration**: Maintain and update lists of known malicious IPs
- **Security Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of security events and traffic patterns
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs of all security events for analysis
- **API Access**: Programmatically manage security settings and view statistics

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TroyKazmov/enhanced-botnet-protection.git
   cd enhanced-botnet-protection

To use the script:

1. Copy the code above into a file named `generate-complete-project.js`
2. Run it with Node.js: 'node generate-complete-project.js'

```shellscript
node generate-complete-project.js
```

The script will create a directory called `enhanced-botnet-protection` with all the files organized in the correct structure. You can then follow the printed instructions to build and run the project.

This enhanced script includes:

1. **Detailed Comments**: Throughout the code files explaining what each component does and how to customize it
2. **Clear Instructions**: For accessing the dashboard with authentication parameters
3. **Security Notes**: Highlighting areas that should be improved for production use
4. **Customization Points**: Marked sections where you might want to modify the code
5. **Better Dashboard UI**: Added explanatory text in the dashboard UI
6. **Improved README**: With clearer instructions on accessing the dashboard


## How to Access the Security Dashboard

After running the project:

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard?username=admin&password=changeme`

1. Replace `admin` and `changeme` with the values you set in your `.env` file
2. The authentication parameters are passed in the URL query string



2. From the dashboard, you can:

1. View real-time statistics on rate limiting and blocked IPs
2. Manually block or unblock IP addresses
3. Access security logs by clicking "View Security Logs"



3. The security logs page shows detailed information about security events:

1. When they occurred
2. What type of event (blocked request, bot detection, etc.)
3. The IP address involved
4. Additional details like user agent or reason for blocking



## Important Security Notes

1. The authentication method used (query parameters) is basic and for demonstration purposes only
2. For production use, implement a more secure authentication method like sessions or JWT
3. Always change the default admin username and password in the `.env` file
4. Consider placing the system behind a reverse proxy like Nginx for additional security
